## Abstract
This research exercise was a reflection of the process, benefits, challenges and outcomes of applying a co-design approach in the exploration for the possible use of Internet of Things (IoT) to support the creation and sustainment of trustworthy community technology and other publicly shared objects in our often culturally diverse neighbourhoods. At the heart of the project is the value derived from not just observing but working directly with the intended end users as experts and collaborators. After an initial assessment that involved literature review and determining a suitable case study, the Dundee West End Community Fridge, run by Gate Church International, was identified because it represents one model of a community-based initiative. Its proximity was a bonus as it gave the researcher an opportunity to volunteer, observe and work directly with the community.

The research followed a mixed approach consisting of probes, interviews, shadowing, observation and a volunteer journey.  This was followed by analysis of the data and initial ideas that were shared with select participants from which concepts were developed. The concepts are later explored during the [prototyping and open technology phase](https://github.com/sktomor/OpenDoTT-communities/tree/master/open-technology). 

## Ethics Approval
