### About the OpenDoTT Project
Open Design of Trusted Things (OpenDoTT) is a joint programme  from the Northumbria University and Mozilla to  explore how to build a more open, secure, and trustworthy Internet of Things (IoT). This program will train technologists, designers, and researchers to create and advocate for connected products that are more open, secure, and trustworthy. The project is made possible through funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 program. 
*If you read an earlier version of this document, please note that the project has now moved from the University of Dundee to Northumbria University in Newcastle. 

Topics:
1. Wearables and the Self
2. Smart Homes
3. **Communities and Neighbourhoods**
4. Smart Cities
5. A Trust Mark for IoT

See [project website](https://opendott.org/).

#### Communities and Neighbourhoods
IoT is often considered at small/personal scales and at very large/city scales, but the physical nature of IoT makes it ideal for street-level technology, while the increased availability of cheap, DIY platforms places it within the realms of possibility for grassroots communities of makers and activists at a local scale. The research will explore the possibilities for smaller-scale local IoT technology and the challenges for IoT operating at this scale.
