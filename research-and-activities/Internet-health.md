## Universal Acceptance
Because we believe that the Internet should be open and accessible to everyone, we agree with the Universal Acceptance Steering Group ([UASG](https://uasg.tech/)) that all domain names and email addresses should work in all software applications (including web and email applications) and accept characters in other language scripts besides the Latin script or the English language. We are organising a webinar series titled "Demistifying Universal Acceptance: What does a multilingual Internet look like?". More information is available in [this repository](https://github.com/Universal-Acceptance-for-You/universal-acceptance-in-uganda) and this [draft agenda](https://github.com/Universal-Acceptance-for-You/universal-acceptance-in-uganda/blob/main/activities-and-events/UA-webinar-series-2021-2022.md). The events will run from July to December 2021.
